    <p class="ben">Ben Parker was born in Brooklyn, New York.
    He trained to be a police officer and also spent time as a singer in a band. He had known his future wife, May Reilly, from their school days, but she, in turn, was naively interested in the boy who was consummated in criminal activities.
    When he came to the repeated night and proposed to her on the spot, Ben was there to expose him as the killer and comfort the heartbroken May when the boy was arrested.
    Their relationship developed into love and they enjoyed their family life together.
    When Ben's younger brother Richard Parker and his wife Mary died in a plane crash,
    Ben and May took in their orphaned son Peter and raised him as their own.
